The Crust

This is the outside layer of the earth and is made of solid rock, mostly basalt and granite. There are two types of crust; oceanic and continental. Oceanic crust is denser and thinner and mainly com​posed of basalt.  Continental crust is less dense, thicker, and mainly composed of granite.

The Mantle

The mantle lies below the crust and is up to 2900 km thick.  It consists of hot, dense, iron and magnesium-rich solid rock. The crust and the upper part of the mantle make up the lithosphere, which is broken into plates, both large and small

The Core

The core is the centre of the earth and is made up of two parts: the liquid outer core and solid inner core. The outer core is made of nickel, iron and molten rock. Temperatures here can reach up to 50,000 C.

Quick Facts:
1.The mantle is about 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometres) thick and makes up about      85% of the Earth's weight.
2.The inner core is nearly as hot as the surface of the sun, and the pressure down there is 3 million times what it is on the surface.
3.Route 66 Is Longer Than the Distance to the Earth's Core.
4. The outer core of the Earth is liquid metal – also mostly nickel and iron.

    //TODO ANIMAL CELL;
    '''
Animal cells are the basic unit of life in organisms of the kingdom Animalia.

They are eukaryotic cells, meaning that they have a true nucleus and specialized structures called organelles that carry out different functions.

Animal cells do not have plant-specific organelles like cell walls, which support the plant cell, or chloroplasts, the organelle that carries out photosynthesis.

All cells are surrounded by a cell membrane (also called a plasma membrane).

The cell membrane is the boundary that separates the inside of the cell from the outside of the cell.

The plasma membrane encloses all the cell components, which are suspended in a gel-like fluid called the cytoplasm.

The cytoplasm is the location of the organelles.

Animals are all multicellular, meaning multiple cells work together to form the whole organism.

 In complex organisms, such as humans, these cells can be highly specialized to perform different functions.

 As such, they often look and function very differently from one another, even though they are all human cells.

Quick Facts:
1.Not all cells have a nucleus.
2.Cells can repair themselves.
3.Cells are self-destructive.
4.The cell is 70% water.

//TODO VOLCANO
''' 
A volcano is a mountain that opens downward to a pool of molten rock below the surface of the earth.

Volcanoes are formed when magma from within the Earth's upper mantle works its way to the surface. At the surface, it erupts to form lava flows and ash deposits. Over time as the volcano continues to erupt, it will get bigger and bigger.

Scientists have categorized volcanoes into three main categories: active, dormant, and extinct. An active volcano is one that has recently erupted and there is a possibility that it may erupt soon. A dormant volcano is one that has not erupted in a long time but there is a possibility it can erupt in the future. An extinct volcano is one which has erupted thousands of years ago and there’s no possibility of an eruption.

Why do volcanoes erupt?
The Earth's crust is made up of huge slabs called plates, which fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. These plates sometimes move. The friction causes earthquakes and volcanic eruptions near the edges of the plates. The theory that explains this process is called plate tectonics.

Quick Facts:
1.There are 20 Volcanoes Erupting Right Now.
2.More than 80% of the earth's surface is volcanic in origin.
3.Gaseous emissions from volcano formed the earth's atmosphere.
4.There are more than 500 active volcanoes in the world.

//TODO BULB

'''
A Brief History of the Light Bulb
The electric light, was not “invented” in 1879 by Thomas Alva Edison. He was neither the first nor the only person trying to invent an incandescent light bulb. In fact, some historians claim there were over 20 inventors of incandescent lamps prior to Edison’s version. 


Early Light Bulbs
In 1802, Humphry Davy invented the first electric light.

In 1840, British scientist Warren de la Rue enclosed a coiled platinum filament in a vacuum tube and passed an electric current through it.  

In 1850 an English physicist named Joseph Wilson Swan developed a longer lasting light bulb using a treated cotton thread that also removed the problem of early bulb blackening.

On July 24, 1874 a Canadian patent was filed by Henry Woodward and a colleague Mathew Evans.   They eventually sold their patent to Edison in 1879.

Thomas Edison and the “first” light bulb,

On October 14, 1878, Edison filed his first patent application for "Improvement In Electric Lights". By Nov 4, 1879, he filed another U.S. patent for an electric lamp using "a carbon filament or strip coiled and connected ... to platina contact wires."

Quick Facts:
1.The average lifetime of a household light bulb is around 1,000 hours.
2.Visible light is just the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that our eyes can see.
3.The first concept and demonstration of heating a wire to produce light was by Ebenezer Kindersley in 1761.
4.The light bulb has long been used as a symbol of innovation, denoting the origination of a smart idea.

//TODO MARS
'''
​Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun – a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past.

Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape.

NASA currently has two rovers (Curiosity and Perseverance), one lander (Insight), and one helicopter (Ingenuity) exploring the surface of Mars.

Gravity: 3.721 m/s²

Distance from Sun: 227.9 million km

Orbital period: 687 days

Surface area: 144.8 million km²

Length of day: 1d 0h 37m

Moons: Phobos, Deimos

Quick Facts:
1.Mars is named after the Roman god of war.
2.Mars is smaller than Earth with a diameter of 4217 miles.
3.Mars has the largest canyon in our solar system.
4.Mars Has Frozen Water Today.

//TODO MAGNET

'''
The history of magnets begins with the first discoveries of magnetic stones or lodestones – starting from 1845 this kind of stone was called magnetite. It is a mostly black mineral of iron and oxygen or iron hydroxide, which develops in a natural way by volcanic activity and has its own magnetic property.

The special characteristics of the magnetite were not only known by the ancient Greeks, the properties of the magnets were also analyzed in China in the pre-Christian times. In the Warring States period Hanfuzius developed there the first compass ever. The “Si Nan”, which literally means the south pointer.

It consisted in a spoon shaped lodestone placed as a compass needle on a flat square bronze or copper plate in which symbols, lines and writings were engraved. The magnetic field of the spoon was aligned so that it pointed again to the south after each rotation. The south was the preferred direction of the Taoist trigrams. It was the direction of the sky, while the north was considered inauspicious.

Quick Facts:

1.Magnets always have two poles -- even if you cut them in half.
2.The most powerful magnet in the universe is actually a star called a magnetar.
3.The Earth is like one big bar magnet.
4.The most powerful magnet in the universe is actually a star called a magnetar.
